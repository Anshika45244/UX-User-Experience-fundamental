Monochromatic â€“ Uses different tints, shades, and tones of a single hue.

Look: Clean, minimal, professional.

Use case: Dashboards, minimal portfolios, corporate designs.

Analogous â€“ Uses colors next to each other on the color wheel (e.g., blueâ€“tealâ€“green).

Look: Harmonious, soothing, natural.

Use case: Health apps, wellness brands, nature-related designs.

Complementary â€“ Uses two colors directly opposite on the wheel (e.g., blue & orange).

Look: High contrast, eye-catching.

Use case: CTAs (call-to-action buttons), marketing banners.

Triadic â€“ Uses three evenly spaced colors on the wheel (e.g., redâ€“yellowâ€“blue).

Look: Balanced but still vibrant.

Use case: Fun apps, gaming interfaces, youth-focused designs.

If you want, I can make a simple visual diagram of these four color schemes so you can instantly remember them while designing in Figma.
